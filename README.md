üöß **Under construction!**

## Usage 


Wrap elements in custom HTML elements to render them as marimo notebooks.

### Open in an new tab
````md
This is a demo site.

```python
a = 1
b = 2
```

This adds a button that links to a marimo playground notebook preloaded
with Python code.

<div>
<marimo-button>
```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
</marimo-button>
</div>
````

### Embed in an inline interactive notebook

````md
This replaces the python code with an inline marimo notebook.
<div>
<marimo-iframe>
```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
</marimo-iframe>
</div>

Multiple code blocks will be replaced with an entire notebook.

<div>
<marimo-iframe>
```python
import marimo as mo
```
```python
slider = mo.ui.slider(1, 10)
slider
```

```python
slider.value * "üçÉ"
```
</marimo-iframe>
</div>

<script src="extractor.js"></script>
````

### Try locally

To run this locally, you only need mkdocs. 

```bash
uv run --with mkdocs-material mkdocs serve
```
